Wouldn't it be useful if you could see whether your construction is robust before you order the parts? Depending on that, you might even find a better solution that is stronger, uses fewer parts, or looks better.
All that should be possible - if you have the right software. Unfortunately, there's currently no software capable of doing a physics analysis of a LEGO model.</description></item></channel></rss>
