Like all dependencies it's included as a git submodule in /src/lib/palanteer. To run BrickSim with Palanteer, you have to build it first. Read the Docs of palanteer to see how to build it. You also have to enable Palanteer in BrickSim. For that you have to enable the CMake option USE_PALANTEER.</description></item></channel></rss>
