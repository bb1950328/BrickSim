The major reason for that choice is to prevent anyone with more resources than the maintainers and direct contributors of BrickSim from forking the project and overtaking it. With GPLv3 all forks must disclose their source too and that allows us to merge it back into the original BrickSim project.
Not all libraries BrickSim uses are under the GPLv3 license, but they are more permissive than GPLv3, so it's possible to use them.</description></item></channel></rss>
