The cloning feature of XCode did't work correctly on my machine, so I cloned it from the command line: git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://www.github.com/bb1950328/BrickSim.git In the terminal, navigate to the cloned folder and execute ./setup_workspace.sh Install CMake. You can install the CMake GUI from here or just the command line version with brew install cmake Then you can generate the XCode project files.</description></item><item><title>Using CLion on Windows</title><link>https://BrickSim.org/docs/contributing/code/workspace_setup/clion_setup_windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BrickSim.org/docs/contributing/code/workspace_setup/clion_setup_windows/</guid><description>Add C:\msys64\usr\bin\ to your windows PATH environment variable.
