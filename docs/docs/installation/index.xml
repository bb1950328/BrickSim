Because it's unclear whether it's allowed to distribute that file together with the program, you have to download it manually. It's really simple:
Go to https://www.bricklink.com/catalogDownload.asp Select &amp;quot;Part and Color Codes&amp;quot;. Also make sure &amp;quot;Tab-Delimited File&amp;quot; is selected. Click on the download button and save the file in the BrickSim folder</description></item></channel></rss>
