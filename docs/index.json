These points form a rectangle. (The standard does not explicitly say that ∠P2 P1 P3 = 90° so they could also form a parallelogram. I don't know what to do in that case, maybe skew the image?) The specified image file is drawn onto that rectangle. P1 is the top-left, P2 the top-right and P3 the bottom-left corner. This image is shown here to explain the next steps, but not in the result. Four Lines that are perpendicular to the rectangle and go through its corners can be calculated. Only points between these lines will get textured. The \u0026lt;geometry1\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;geometry2\u0026gt; sections contain geometry to which the texture is applied. In this animation it's the Blender Monkey. If we want to know how a given point on the object is colored, we cast a ray that starts from the given point and is perpendicular to the rectangle. The color of the texture at the point where the ray meets the rectangle is taken. The raycasting process is done for all points on the object. We can see that the texture is not mapped to the outer half of the monkey's ear. This is because the ray misses the texture there. In that case the color of the point is taken from the geometry line, as if there was no !TEXMAP at all.   (Download the .blend or the individual images)  Cylindrical Mapping  There are three points specified: P1(x1, y1, z1), P2(x2, y2, z2) and P3(x3, y3, z3). I think that ∠P2 P1 P3 should be 90°, but that's not stated in the standard. P1 and P2 will form the radial axis (red line). A part of a cylindrical surface is taken (blue). The angle is a and the middle is at P3. The radius equals to the distance between P1 and P3. The texture image is put onto that blue cylindrical plane. This image is only shown in the animation, it's not part of the result. The object formed from the \u0026lt;geometry1\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;geometry2\u0026gt; lines usually is near P1 and P2. But I think it also can be outside the blue plane. Only points between the black lines will get textured. To find the color for a given point on the object, a ray has to be casted. It is perpendicular to the radial axis and goes through the given point. If the ray also goes through the image plane, the color of the given point is the color of the texture at the intersection point. If the ray misses the plane, the color of the given point is taken from the geometry line, as if there was no !TEXMAP at all. When that process is done for all points on the object, the texture is cylindrically projected onto it.

Wouldn't it be useful if you could see whether your construction is robust before you order the parts? Depending on that, you might even find a better solution that is stronger, uses fewer parts, or looks better.\nAll that should be possible - if you have the right software. Unfortunately, there's currently no software capable of doing a physics analysis of a LEGO model.\nBrickSim will change that.\nPlan / Ideas  The analysis model is just another object inside the element tree. The user can  hide it delete it enable automatic recomputing if his computer is fast enough or his model small enough   If the element is visible, the bricks should be displayed in rainbow colors over the original bricks (red means high stress, green means low stress)  Technical Implementation Part weight The weight of all parts that consist only of normal ABS plastic can be calculated relatively easily. We can calculate the volume using the method described in this paper or use a library like the GNU Triangulated Surface Library.\nWe can get the weights of each brick directly using the BrickLink Catalog Download. This is the only way to get the correct volume for all parts which contain non-ABS materials.\nConnections between parts A lot of information about how the parts can be connected is already available in the LDraw parts library. All parts are composed of primitives. The Primitive Reference lists them all. Unfortunately not all connections can be derived from primitives. For example the underside stud of a 1x1 brick isn't made from primitives. Therefore, we need a list to add additional connections.\nThis component can later be reused for part snapping.\nData Structure It's better to not use the element tree directly as the data structure. It should be simplified to a collection of parts because physics do not care about the part hierarchy of a model, and the code would just be unnecessarily complex.\n","link":"https://BrickSim.org/docs/features/static_analysis/","title":"Static Analysis"},{"body":"Read this section if you are interested how BrickSim is made.\n","link":"https://BrickSim.org/docs/technical_info/","title":"Technical Information"},{"body":" add C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin to PATH Download and install VS Code from here if you haven't already Install the extensions ms-vscode.cpptools and ms-vscode.cmake-tools Open the BrickSim folder in VS Code. you should get the notifications like in the following screenshot (at least the first one):\nclick \u0026quot;yes\u0026quot; on the first notification, we'll deal with the second one later.

The cloning feature of XCode did't work correctly on my machine, so I cloned it from the command line: git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://www.github.com/bb1950328/BrickSim.git In the terminal, navigate to the cloned folder and execute ./setup_workspace.sh Install CMake. You can install the CMake GUI from here or just the command line version with brew install cmake Then you can generate the XCode project files.   If you have the CMake GUI, you can configure the project like this:\n Set the path of the directory you just cloned BrickSim into:  Click on \u0026quot;Configure\u0026quot; (Click on \u0026quot;Yes\u0026quot; if the question \u0026quot;Build directory does not exist, should I create it?\u0026quot; pops up:  Click on \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot; after setting the generator to \u0026quot;Xcode\u0026quot;.

When there are no errors, click the \u0026quot;Generate\u0026quot; Button. The \u0026quot;Open Project\u0026quot; Button isn't greyed out anymore, and you can click it too.    If you have the command line cmake, execute the following commands:\n1 2 3  mkdir -p cmake-build cd cmake-build cmake -G Xcode ..   (you have to be inside the BrickSim directory initially) Then you can open the project in Xcode.\n   When Xcode has loaded the project, you have to switch the target to BrickSim:  After that, you should be able to build and run BrickSim.
